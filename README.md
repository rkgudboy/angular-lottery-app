# angular-lottery-app
UI Task for WedMeGood hiring
## Problem Statement
There is a competition where we have 3 types of prizes (14 in total):

- 10 Movie Tickets 
- 3 Mobile Phones 
- 1 Bike

Game to be played locally, no backend data.
8 random images to be shown to user in grid. As user clicks on one image it flips and shows a movie name and as it clicks on another image, it again flips and may show the same or another movie name.
If movie names are same on both image , show an animation for congrats and a button for play again.
If movie names are different show an animation for sorry and a button to play again .
Remaining prizes should always be visible on the top RHS as a legend.
